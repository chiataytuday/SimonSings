SIMON SINGS

Simon Sings is a fun music and memory training game for the iPhone. Learn to 
sing, improve your hearing, and train your memory... at the same time!

Simon plays a sequence of musical notes that you have to memorize and then 
repeat by singing, humming or whistling into the iPhone's microphone. With each
new round the sequence becomes longer and harder to remember.

Start in Beginner mode with only 3 possible notes, move up to Intermediate with 
6 notes, and finally become a Maestro by mastering all 12 notes of the musical 
alphabet.

How many notes can *you* memorize and sing in tune?
